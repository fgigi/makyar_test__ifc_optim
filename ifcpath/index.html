			<div class="itemContent">
				Path planning is a fundamental problem, especially for various AEC applications,
				such as architectural design, indoor and outdoor navigation, and emergency evacu-
				ation. However, the conventional approaches mainly operate path planning on 2D
				drawings or building layouts by only considering the geometric information, while
				losing abundant semantic information of building objects.
				To address this issue, we introduce a new method to cope with path planning
				for 3D indoor space through an IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) file as input.
				As a major data exchange standard for Building Information Modeling (BIM), the
				IFC standard is capable of restoring both geometric information and rich semantic
				information of building objects to support lifecycle data sharing. Our method con-
				sists of three main steps: (1) extracting both geometric and semantic information
				of building elements defined within the IFC file, (2) discretizeing and mapping the
				extracted information into a plane grid, (3) and finally finding the shortest path
				based on the mapping for path planning using Fast Marching Method. We aim
				to process different kinds of building elements and their corresponding properties
				to obtain rich semantic information that enhances path planning. The paper also
				presents some experiments to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and adaptability.
